Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.
You are running snakemake in a SLURM job context. This is not recommended, as it may lead to unexpected behavior. Please run Snakemake directly on the login node.
