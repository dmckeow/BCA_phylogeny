# GENERAL NOTES
  # Passing parameters to tools:
    # For options ending with <_params> you can put any commandline options for the tool here, as they are normally used, except those that are defined separately in this config file. If you do not wish to specify any parameters, then simply leave the option with "". If an option is defined separately here, then it is simply to require the user to specify input for that parameter.

# WORKFLOW CONTROL
  # Rules indicated here will be run if TRUE (in double quotes), skipped if set to anything else
